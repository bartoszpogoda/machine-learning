# machine-learning

That's my implementation of two classifiers:
  - KNN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
  - Nearest mean classifier (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_centroid_classifier)
  
I am using weka-dev-3.7.9.jar as external dependency for data read and storage purposes.
